# Handwritten digit recognition
A attempt to train a simple model with 10 neurons and 2 hidden layers to recognize handwritten digits on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.
Using fabric.js to build a simple browser drawing tools to feed into the model and output prediction.

cgi-bin/mnist.py - file for drawing and output prediction.
python -m http.server --cgi 8000 to open a localhost server.

build_model.ipynb - jupyter notebook for building and training models.

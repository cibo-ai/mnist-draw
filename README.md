# handwritten-digit
A attempt to train a simple model with 10 neurons and 2 hidden layers to recognize handwritten digits on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch.
Using fabric.js to build a simple browser drawing tools to feed into the model and output prediction.

cgi-bin/mnist.py - file for drawing and output prediction.
handwritten-digit.ipynb - jupyter notebook for building and training models.
